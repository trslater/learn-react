# Learn React

This repo is for learning React and React testing.

I was going to follow [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vfQ6SWBZ-U), but I didn't like the teaching style, and found it hard to keep track in a 2 hr YouTube video.

I am now going to start with [this tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-fundamentals).

I may also check out the following free courses on Udemy:

## Differences to Tutorial

-   Using Vite instead of CRAâ€”this is a more modern scaffolding tool and is faster
